# Amp Jump Mode in VSCode

Amp Jump is an extension to quickly move around the code using the Amp Editor [Jump Mode](https://amp.rs/docs/usage/#jump-mode).

Press `alt+f` to enter the amp-jump mode and then type the two letter combo to jump to any place in the visible editor screen.

After inserting a valid combo the amp-jump mode is disabled and you can return to edit your text normally.
